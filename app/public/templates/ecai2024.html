            <h4>1. Description</h4>
            <p>
              This tutorial aims to support ontology developers to reduce the
              time consumed in ontology implementation by generating graphical
              ontology conceptualizations that can be converted into code
              automatically. Participants will gain knowledge about the Chowlk
              visual notation for ontologies, how to use the Chowlk converter to
              accelerate ontology implementation based on the generated
              conceptualizations, how to use the related resources as templates
              and, finally, how to create new templates.
            </p>

            <p>
              This tutorial will focus on explaining 1) the Chowlk notation,
              origin, motivation and current status; 2) how to use the converter
              to accelerate the ontology implementation activity based on the
              generated diagram; 3) how to use the related resources as
              templates; and finally 4) how to create new templates. The
              tutorial will be mainly practical and interactive, driving the
              attendees through the Chowlk framework features by using them. In
              this sense we will “Introduce expert non-specialists to an AI
              subarea” (ontology development) and “Provide instruction in
              established but specialized AI methodologies.”

              finished in 2010 in the same university. She has contributed to
              the ontology engineering field developing methodologies and tools
              like OOPS! (Ontology Pitfall Scanner!) which has been broadly
              adopted by the community, the LOT methodology for building
              ontologies and the Chowk framework for ontology conceptualization
              and implementation. She has worked in the context of Spanish
              research projects as well as in European. She has contributed to
              the organization of the "Linked Data in Architecture and
              Construction Workshop" since 2015 edition, the "13th OWL:

              evaluation workshop" in 2016, the Workshop on Ontology Patterns
              (WOP) in 2019 and 2022, the "Linked Energy Data Vocamp" in 2015
              and she has organized the 2nd Summer School of Linked Data in
              Architecture and Construction. Finally, she is part of the W3C Web
              of Things Working Group. Her teaching activities involve teaching
              semantic web and ontological engineering in different courses at
              official degrees, masters courses, MOOCs and online masters as
              well to deliver courses to the administration and private
              companies. She has carried out similar tutorials as “Catching up
              with ontological engineering. To git-commit and beyond” at
              EKAW2018 and “Integrating ontological development with software

              interoperability. He has authored more than 150 publications and
              regularly participates in standardization and in the conferences
              and workshops that are most relevant in his field. He has a strong
              interest and expertise in ontological engineering, where he has
              contributed in topics such as ontological engineering
              methodologies (with the Linked Open Terms methodology), ontology
              testing (with the Themis suite), or ontology visualization (with
              the Chowlk notation). Furthermore, he has developed ontologies in
              many projects and in standardization bodies (W3C, ETSI). His

              Sergio Mario Carulli-Pérez studied at the Universidad Politécnica
              de Madrid (UPM), where he graduated in Mathematics and Computer
              Science. Furthermore, not satisfied with his studies, he also
              obtained a master's degree in Data Science at the UPM. After
              finishing the master's degree, he started working as a researcher
              at the Ontology Engineering Group (OEG), which is a laboratory
              affiliated to the UPM where he has been working since 2022. His
              responsibilities include developing ontologies to support
              artificial intelligence integration and working as a full stack
              developer providing different services for the OEG. In the field
              of ontology development, he has developed an extension to the
              Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) ontology called SAREF4GRID
              (https://saref.etsi.org/saref4grid/), which is an extension for
              the electric grid domain. Moreover, in the full stack developer
              field, he has developed Chowlk, an application that allows to
              create the OWL implementation of an ontology from its
              conceptualisation.
